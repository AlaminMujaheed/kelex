## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5), evoking trust, stability, and professionalism, which are crucial for an employment platform.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5), offering a clean and modern backdrop that doesn't distract from the content.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080), providing a contrasting highlight for key interactive elements and calls to action, drawing the user's eye without overwhelming the design.
- Body text: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif), chosen for its modern look and good readability in longer texts. Headline Font: 'Playfair' (serif) for elegant, fashionable titles.
- Modern and consistent icons, using a thin line style to match the clean interface. Icons should be intuitive and represent various job sectors, functionalities, and actions.
- Mobile-first, responsive layout with a clean, grid-based structure. Content should be easily accessible and optimized for various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices.
- Subtle and purposeful animations, such as smooth transitions and loading indicators, to enhance user engagement without being distracting. Micro-interactions provide feedback for user actions.
